// While USD/2 is a reasonable notation for most USD-handling use-cases, 
// nothing prevents you from using USD/4 or USD/6 if you need to represent 
// smaller amounts and subdivisions of USD in your system. The same applies to 
// other currencies, e.g. JPY/2 or JPY/4 for Japanese Yen and while such a coin 
// is not in circulation, it is still a valid notation when these amounts are 
// used in a context where they will end up being floored or ceiled to the 
// nearest whole unit later down the line.
